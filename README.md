#proj 2


this is a project concluding my coding from scratch. no use of other coders coding are applied in this game. I will take to inspiration of other
coders who used this and as i did, i did it from ONLY viewing the persons live view. 
All is done by HTML and a lil CSS in my case.

please enjoy, its also free to use. and you can take credit for it, i dont care.
